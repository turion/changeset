{- | A general state monad transformer with separate types for the state and the possible changes, updates, commits, or diffs.

A typical example is a large state type (e.g., a user entry in a database of a webshop)
which only allows small changes (e.g., adding or deleting a delivery address):

@
data User = User
  { userName :: Text
  , password :: Hash
  , ...
  , addresses :: Map Text Address
  , ...
  }
@

When we want to be able to /restrict/ to specific changes (e.g., only the addresses should be changed),
and we want to be able to /inspect/ the changes,
then 'ChangesetT' is a good choice.
In our example, a general function on addresses, or even on the whole user, cannot be inspected.
But if we restrict to only adding or deleting addresses,
we can define a custom datatype such as:

@
data ChangeAddress
  -- | Add an address under a given key
  = Add Text Address
  -- | Delete the address for the given key
  | Delete Text
@

Changes for such a type (or rather, for the monoid @'Changes' ChangeAddress@) can be inspected.

'ChangesetT' is a very general state monad transformer.
It has all the standard state monads from @transformers@ as special cases:

+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Transformer special case | State type    | Monoid type | Intuition                                   |
+==========================+===============+=============+=============================================+
| @'WriterT' w@            | '()'          | @w@         | No possibility to observe the current state |
+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
| @'AccumT' w@             | @'Regular' w@ | @w@         | The state is the same type as the changes   |
+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
| @'StateT' s@             | @s@           | @First s@   | The change overwrites all previous changes  |
+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+

The @changeset@ ecosystem has support for standard @containers@ and optics from @lens@
by providing the packages [@changeset-containers@](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/changeset-containers) and [@changeset-lens@](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/changeset-lens).

-- * The 'ChangesetT' monad transformer

{- | Hold a state of type @s@, which is allowed to be mutated by an action of a monoid @w.@

The state @s@ has the role of the current state.
An @a@ is computed while performing a side effect in @m@,
and these can depend on the current state.

The type @w@ encodes /changes/ (or updates, edits, commits, diffs, patches ...) to the state @s.@
This relation is captured by the 'RightAction' type class from @monoid-extras.@
It contains a method, @'act' :: w -> s -> s@,
which implements the semantics of @w@ as the type of updates to @s.@

The standard example is that of a big record where we only want to change a small portion:

@
data User = User
  { name :: Text
  , password :: Hash
  , ...
  , addresses :: Map Text Address
  , ...
  }
@

If all changes that our business logic should be able to perform are adding or deleting an address,
it would be cumbersome to work in a @'State' User@ monad, since we only want to modify a small portion.
Instead, we define a type of /changes/ to @User@:

@
data ChangeAddress
  -- | Add an address under a given key
  = Add Text Address
  -- | Delete the address for the given key
  | Delete Text

instance RightAction ChangeAddress User where
  act = ...
@

Now we can conveniently work in the monad @'ChangesetT' User [ChangeAddress] m.@
(Note the list type which gives us a free 'Monoid' instance.)
Here we can perform operations like @'change' [Add "home" homeAddress]@ or @'change' [Delete "work"]@ to modify the addresses,
'current' to view the current state (containing all changes so far),
or apply a more complex function like @'revise' $ const $ filter (/= Delete "default")@ which would remove all changes that attempt to delete the @"default"@ address.

As a further example, if @s@ represents some type of time stamps, then @w@ can be a type of durations:
Two timestamps cannot be added, but two durations can.
A computation in @'ChangesetT' s w@ could then have access to some simulated notion of "current time",
while being able to add symbolic "delays".

Another class of examples arises operation based or commutative Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT).
Then @s@ is the internal state (the "payload") of the CRDT, and @w@ is the update operation.
For example @s = Int@, and for @w@ we would define @data Count = Increment | Decrement.@

The 'Monad' and 'Applicative' classes are defined by performing the first action,
then 'act'ing with the monoid output onto the state, and then perform the second action with the updated state.
So for example, @'change' Increment >> 'current'@ is different from @'current' >>= (\n -> 'change' Increment >> return n)@:
If we apply @'flip' 'evalChangeset' 0@ to each,
the first one would return 1, while the second returns 0.

So, if at any point in a @do@ notation we want to inspect the current state,
we can assume that all previous changes have been applied.
In that sense, this monad behaves very much like any other state monad transformer.
